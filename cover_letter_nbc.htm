        <h2>COVER LETTER</h2>
        <p>
          I'll try to keep this brief. I'm very excited about the opportunity to be able to work with the entire team at
          NBC Universal. So far I have met Samantha, Clarissa, Kathleen, and Cindy-- and it's clear that NBC has a
          stellar team supporting the various brands. I'm thrilled at the opportunity to learn from and get to know each
          of them and the NBC universe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the past 12 years, I've obtained a multitude of specialized experience in the email marketing world.
          Primarily, I have a rock solid foundation with email development, QA, and I think like a designer. I
          feel
          that I am set up to really knock some socks off at NBC-- with this role challenging me in a couple of new and
          exciting ways. For one, I would be in a managerial position for the first time. And secondly, I would be
          owning the deployment and audience management in a much bigger way than I ever have. To me, this means new
          learnings, which is really what it's all about.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've just moved to Los Angeles 10 months ago, so it would feel really special to work in the "Industry" over
          at
          Universal City (eventually), and be a part of something with so much history. The timing feels perfect!
        </p>
        <p>
          I've long been a fan of the NBC brand- something that really sealed the deal for me was the wonderful 30 Rock.
          So, even though I feel a bit like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3htEX-C2ts"
            style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000011;">Kenneth</a>, I'm trying to contain my excitement. I
          hope that we're able to work together and do some amazing work done together, pushing these already iconic
          brands even further.
